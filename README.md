# Telecom Customer Churn Analysis (Power BI)

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze customer churn for a telecom company and identify the strongest factors influencing churn (e.g., contract type, data usage, customer service calls).

---

## Dataset
This project uses telecom customer data including demographic, usage, contract, and churn information.  
The file `Databel - Data.csv` contains all data used for the analysis.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop** – Dashboard design & analytics
- **DAX** – KPIs and measures
- **Data Modeling** – Segmentation and grouping
- **CSV dataset** for source data

---

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
These were created as measures in Power BI:
- **Total Customers**
- **Churn Rate %**
- **Avg Customer Service Calls**
- **Avg Extra International Charges**
- **Avg Extra Data Charges**

---

## Dashboard Pages
Your Power BI report includes the following:
- **Overview:** Overall churn metrics and KPI cards  
- **Contract Analysis:** Churn by contract category  
- **Usage Analysis:** Churn vs data usage groups  

---

## Key Insights
- Monthly contract customers have **higher churn** than yearly contracts.  
- Customers with **higher data usage** are more likely to churn.  
- More **customer service calls** correlate with increased churn.

---

## Business Recommendations
- Offer incentives or discounts for customers on yearly contracts.  
- Target high‑usage monthly customers with retention offers.  
- Improve quality & responsiveness of customer service to reduce churn.
